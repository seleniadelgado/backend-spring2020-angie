I am using CSS variables for the colors and fonts:
For the main color of the app's body, I am using a gradient:
--main-color: linear-gradient(#FF416C, #FF4B2B);
For the background of the app, I will use this color:
--background-color: whitesmoke;
I like it because it's a little off white, not just plain boring white.
I chose these fonts because I feel like they look like the title of accomplishing something.
--title-font: 'Abril Fatface', cursive, sans-serif;
This one went well with the title. I chose a combination that worked well together.
--list-font: 'Lato', sans-serif;
I tried different sizes but decided in the end this is the best one for my project.
--font-size-title: 20px;
--font-size-list-item: 18px;
